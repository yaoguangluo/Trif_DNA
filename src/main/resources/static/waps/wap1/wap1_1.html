    <br/> Story - ELS: Wearing a formal suit and putting on a pair of
    black leather shoes, tightly stood in the hall of ELS. I felt happy and
    some fear, which was entwined in my heart. A rectangular, black table
    stood on the soft, gray and smooth carpet. I carried a package, which
    was loaded with important documents. Where I could see a lot of
    international students with fashionable clothes. I felt culture shock
    because the faces were not familiar to me. Ordinary I was used to
    seeing people with black hair, not people with yellow or brown hair. In
    China, all the people have dark eyes but here the people have blue,
    brown or green eyes, as I looked at all the strange faces and eyes,
    then began to feel anxious. I was reading a newspaper when the phone
    rang. Glancing around the hall quickly, and found everyone focused on
    their work. My heart had become calm after I put my cell phone on mute.
    To the left I could see through the window where the director's office
    was. The furnishings were a bit small but arranged orderly in a small
    area. A corridor with access to the LTC was next to the door. I was so
    happy to see where some Chinese people were waiting for their
    interviews.
    <br/>
    <br/> To the right was a gate to the small hall, I saw a soft sofa
    here, ELS's teacher's photos were hanging on the white wall next to the
    sofa. I stood near the back gate where I could see some magazines in
    the holding hook, straight ahead was a vast globe map, I found out my
    hometown immediately and pointed It out suddenly, and felt friendly and
    warmly. When I went into Asian room, I could remember very clearly that
    to my right was a rectangular, new white board where Mr. Joel wrote our
    English sessions. I quietly seated at the first rank and looked toward
    at front of my eye sight, two narrow windows with white blinds on them,
    looked to pass the windows, where I could see many tall and straight
    pine trees with lush and green leaves on them. My mood had brightened
    lot. Everyone has a door in the deep heart, and the beautiful
    environment is often the best key, as a famous says" If you can't
    change the world, change yourself.".<br/>
    <br/>
    <br/> 作者还要感谢2019年9月抖音认识北大杨叶,作者持续了3个月系统的学习了书法笔画研究关于
    蝌蚪文, 金文, 纂, 小篆, 片假文, 竹节文, 汉简, 晋刻和隶书的书写方式, 叠加方式, 组合方式.
    以及浏阳三联2018年3月 作者在这待了2个星期实习怎么思维表达当老师.
    <br/>
    <br/> 作者最后要感谢lucene分词和中科院的基于lucene分词的上层隐马科夫中文概率分词分析插件,
    2009年给作者启蒙了软件分词算法的意识，以及阅读了华中科技等大学的仅仅基于拼音概率分词的论文思维.
    <br/>
    <br/> 有了上述这6点基础, 再加上国外5年课程学历用英语教学, 于是作者在编码养疗经华瑞集系统的时候,
    因为lucene中文分词速度逐渐跟不上亿字的分词搜索需求, 有魄力201808+ 自己重新开始写个分词软件并一直优化它.
    <br/>
    <br/> 作者以为没有学高三英语 (当时浏阳三中转校浏阳一中, 人家已经学完了在复习了,
    作者少学了很多科目) 会有遗憾, 现在发现, 当年的这些遗憾因为这些年持续的作业,
    都通过另一种价值方式体现了.

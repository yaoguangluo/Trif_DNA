    <br/>第五章_德塔数据结构变量快速转换
    <br/> 作者: 罗瑶光, Author:Yaoguang.Luo<br/>

    <br/>基础应用: 元基催化与肽计算 编译机的内存分析机

    场景变换 <br/>
    <br/>
    1 德塔数据结构的场景主要应用在网页html数据抓取, 文本数据计算refer page 508, 492~ <br/>
    <br/>
    2 html数据 主要体现在文字的编码格式变换, 加密变换, 和http response的内容载体变换如json.
    refer page 508, 555, <br/>
    <br/>
    3 文本数据计算主要体现在 map和array的变换, 与 list和array的变换, 用于字符串排序加速.
    refer page, 499, 516, 520 <br/>
    <br/>
    4 在德塔分词场景中体现在另外String与 StringBuilder的加速变换. refer page 536 <br/>

    20220409 截至目前作者接触过得所有计算机变量载体和object对象类型总数, 远远的超过图中的
    列举类型, 作者发现这些类型, 都或多或少有图中的类型的影子, 或者包含有图中类型的类似结构.
    比如枚举作者没有画图, 枚举便类似struct, 同时又具有array的地址连续性, 等作者不多做解释了
    , 计算机语言书籍 有枚举的标准定义.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    每次想到数据结构我能有这种造诣,溯源下,还是对数字逻辑的极其深刻的理解,于是又想起了JPSir.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    JPSir was my teacher, every time I thought of him. My eyes such as the
    lake. <br/>
    <br/>
    The first story <br/>
    <br/>
    I still remembered a class where JPSir let us do the assembly language
    for deletion. He said we can't use 8086/ or other higher vesion to do
    this logic. So, we try to using 8085. After I searched all the asm
    commands, I did not find any resource about deletion. Then JPSir came
    and asked, how does computer deletion? I got results, using n's
    complement and implement and added 1, if got carry, then did a
    complement and added 1 again. Then he got a smell, 8086's deletion was
    truly promoted with this method. After this session, I strongly knowing
    that science was an evolution-inheritance. For everything we know how
    to use it, and we also need to know how to made it. <br/>
    <br/>
    The second story <br/>
    <br/>
    This was a computer IC class and we needed to do a runtime design of
    CPU, to make a calculation of each ASM command processing, we also need
    to draw the state graph. When I finished the question, I saw him toward
    with me and looked carefully with my graph, after a while and asked me
    where did the clock comments? I said at the left parts, he was angry
    with me and said: why you write at the left part? all the book, all the
    resource was for the right. Suddenly I knew my mistake, and speedly
    changed to the right side. After this session, I strongly knowing that
    science was a rigorous and an accuracy, everything we know how to use
    it, but we could not to make change of it. <br/>

    <br/>第二章 Java 数据分析算法引擎系统

    <br/>关于 Etl Unicorn对 音频卷积处理的文字描述
    <br/>
    <br/>作者在将计算机视觉的课程进行了pipe line etl处理后看了乐观的结果, 作者想,
    这些cnn卷积算法一定也可以处理线性的声音领域. 于是开始基于java sound包来分析语音,
    如图所示 wave read 的开头还有很多小点的噪音, 通过max-min(低滤高滤)过滤后

    <br/>就没有噪点, 这张图片是作者从早期2014的测试截图, 当时还没有涉及傅里叶频率域变换,
    谐波噪声平滑等高级功能. 作者的当时主要动机是测试作者心跳

    <br/>About the prefix convolutional computing's, LWA (from left to the
    right, or from head to the tail), the author did a first conference at
    Shanghai Electrics, China, about the Butterworth lowpass and Sawtooth
    wavelet. Then did a fulfillment of convolutional vision at Cal Lutheran,
    USA. The author considered not only the prefix convolutional computing's,
    the Arabic postfix RWA (from right to the left, or from tail to the
    head) also could be well in the wavelet.
    <br/>
    <br/>2019-06-23 Author's notes on Gitee. 2006, Nanjing, the author
    first touched the Fourier's formula set A*cosB+ B*sinA where in his
    bachelor's class of High Frequency Circuit, HFC wavelet. At 2007, the
    author learned a derivation of A*cosB and A*sinB collections where in
    REVA institute. Bangalore University. And got LRC formula of Ui(t)=
    L*di(t)/dt+ 1/C*df i(t)*dt + R*i(t) with L*C*d*d*U0*(t)/dt*dt +
    R*C*d*U0(t)/dt + U0(t), Professor. JPSir, at Christ University, 2009.
    Then made a presentation of Fourier's transformation wavelet at KaiTong
    Ltd, Shanghai. After got a few experience of frequent wavelet, the
    author continued a fulfillment of convolutional computer-vision at USA,
    and tested a FFT and DCT sound communications at Liuyang, 2014~2015.
    Finally tried to make an analyst of dyslexia-brains and partner with
    Sir. Newton Howard at Oxford University, UK.
    <br/>
    <br/>Once done of the DETA Parser at 2019, the author considered a
    VPCS could make a differential and integration in the same time. It was
    a symmetric statement. And the DNA sessional encryption was the same
    too, for example the differential PDE -> PDS and an integration of PDS
    -> PDE. The author considered It could be used in parallel RNA IC
    disign.
    <br/>
    <br/>Implements of non convolutional vision-computing's. The author
    considered a convolutional matrix of kernel, was a centre of computing,
    means the scale size was 3, then will do 3* 3= 9 calculations by each
    set. If the scale size was 4, means to do 4 * 4=16 times. So, the
    formula was M sets * O(N*N). Therefore, the author considered a non
    convolutional algorithms was needed by today's. For example, of DNA
    non-convolutional vision-computing's.
    <br/>
    <br/>Implements of convolutional wavelet-component by ETL Unicorn.
    <br/>
    <br/>Once done of computer vision at 2012, the author considered It
    could work as an Etl pipe node, then build a Unicorn vision tools. Then
    integrated a Java sound API, the below pictures did a well show of the
    proofs. for example, a max-min node pipe to the proportion-taylor node,
    to perform a heartbeats-filter.
